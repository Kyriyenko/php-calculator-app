Here is your docker-compose.yml file that will run PHP 8.2 with Apache in the container.

Make sure Docker is installed and running on your local machine.

At the command line, run the following command in the directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located:

``docker-compose up -d``

This will launch a container with your PHP application. You can access it in a web browser by going to http://localhost:8080.

You now have a development environment for PHP 8.2 with Apache in a Docker container.
